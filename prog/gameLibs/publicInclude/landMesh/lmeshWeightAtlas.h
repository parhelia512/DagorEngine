// One atlas texture replacing all per-cell land detail weight textures.
// The per-cell entry layout and how a weight is read from it live in
// shaders/land_weight_atlas.hlsli, shared with the sampling code.
// Pages carry a border with the neighbouring cells' weights so bilinear
// filtering is seamless across cell boundaries (legacy clamped per cell).
// The exporter packs the atlas and the level ships it (savePacked); older
// level binaries ship per-cell weight textures, which the legacy conversions
// pack at load until every location is re-exported.
// The class spans several translation units: lmeshWeightAtlas.cpp (records,
// page packing, the packed form) and lmeshWeightAtlasLegacyCpu.cpp stay
// driver-free, so the exporter can link them alone; the public constructor,
// upload(), bindCells(), setCellMapping(), createLoaded(), Builder::finish()
// and land_weight_atlas_cpu_pack() live in lmeshWeightAtlasGpu.cpp, and
// setCellRecord()/renderCell() in lmeshWeightAtlasLegacyGpu.cpp, which need
// the driver and shader libraries.
