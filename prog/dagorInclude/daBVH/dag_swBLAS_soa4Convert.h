// Conversions between the stackless BLAS layout (dag_swBLAS_ray.h, the GPU upload format) and the
// SoA4 CPU layout (dag_swBLAS_soa4.h). Both directions rebuild only the tree region and re-point
// the leaf apex bases; the vert21 vert region is copied verbatim. A SoA4 -> stackless -> SoA4 (or
// the reverse) round trip is byte-identical for SAH-built trees. Implemented in soa4Convert.cpp.

// sizing and emit passes differently, so the two-pass agreement holds by construction. A dropped
// leaf is not emitted and an internal child whose whole subtree drops is pruned; kept boxes are
// NOT refit (conservative over the unfiltered subtree; the status says EmittedCarved). When every
// leaf drops the status is AllCarved (no buffer, no fault), distinct from a structural Failed.
